    <p style="color: #dddddd; position: absolute; bottom: 30%; left: 10%; padding: 20px"> During the break, I created an Arduino Water Irrigation system that can be used in daily routines. It is used to automate the process of watering plants. This system uses sensors to detect the moisture level of soil and controls the flow of water accordingly, which helps to conserve water and keep the plants healthy at the same time. The system can be customized as per the requirements, such as the amount of water and moisture level of each part.</p>
    <p style="color: #dddddd; position: absolute; bottom: 20%; left: 10%; padding: 20px"> Other than maintaining the water level, the Arduino water irrigation system can also use other sensors, such as temperature and humidity. Thus, it can adjust watering schedules based on weather conditions. This can be mainly used for farmers who can save time and effort for those who manage multiple farms. In short, the Arduino water irrigation system is a cost-effective and efficient solution for automating the process of watering plants.</p>

    <p style="color: #dddddd; position: absolute; bottom: -33%; left: 10%; padding: 20px">As first-year computer science freshmen, we were given a task to develop a project using simple syntax and with very limited boundaries as a code limit. The main goal was to develop something that could be useful for college freshmen, something they might need during their first year. We focused on many ideas, but we observed that we were unable to present them well in front of the audience, or as expected. So, we decided to develop something that could give fellow students some practice based on their career and job options. We collected a bunch of well-known jobs applied by college students and prepared some general questions and answers given by experts. Then, we broke down the answers into a string of specific words that either showed confidence or power in the applicant. As per user input, it gives suggestions and points that can guide the student to get a chance for practice and boost their confidence level. </p>

And from the first day I started to code with some basic index of html and later as the time continued i started exploreing new feature of html with css and from where my website started looking something more than just a skeleton. Now it got some texture and design. And during the send phrase I am still using the same conspect but with time I am getting better on it. I am glad that I got a chance to dive into this pool of website coding. I am loving it and I also decided to continues this during summer break and learn some more complex things about the website development. And develop something which we daily get in front of.  </p</div>
